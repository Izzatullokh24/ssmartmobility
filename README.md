Firstly, I wrote a code(sudo apt update

sudo apt install ros-humble-turtlesim) to install the turtlesim humble versio. And then I tried to check the package is installed or not. then terminal returned the comman 
turtlesim draw_square
turtlesim mimic
turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
turtlesim turtlesim_node

To start the turtlesim, I entered the following command (ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node)
